# Open Issues / TODOs (as of 2025-08-25)

## IndependentFormBuilder
- [ ] Fix export bug: `Publish failed: builder did not expose an export method (tried module/window + onExport).`
- [ ] Clean up stray text inserted during Cursor test (remove any non-JS instructions).

## Network Admin UI
- [ ] Add proper Practices panel (with public key + submissions view).
- [ ] Improve bundle assignment workflow (assign + verify).

## Bundle Publish Flow
- [ ] Ensure publish → API works without scope errors.
- [ ] Verify Patient App receives active bundle and can submit responses end-to-end.

## Patient App
- [ ] Confirm demo assessment loads live bundle from API.
- [ ] Submit a response and verify it encrypts and uploads correctly.

## API / Prisma
- [ ] Double-check `Bundle` model (remove obsolete `scope` field, no duplicate POST handlers).
- [ ] Ensure seeding scripts cover org → network → practice → membership → patient.
- [ ] Verify `/submissions` and `/blob` routes return expected fields.

## General
- [ ] Style/UI consistency (panels, cards, buttons).
- [ ] Confirm auth gating works (JWT with NetworkMembership).
- [ ] Document workflows in README.

Next Session Priorities:
1. Fix IndependentFormBuilder export → bundle publish bridge.
2. Verify end-to-end: publish bundle in Network Admin → load in Patient App → submit → decrypt as doctor.
