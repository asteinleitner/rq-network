You are editing a guarded monorepo. Hard rules:
1) Edit ONLY inside ONE folder per session under apps/<app-name>.
2) NEVER modify folders: wrappers/** or packages/**.
3) All network and DB access must go through `@rq/api-client`.
4) Do not change any types in `@rq/contracts` or logic in `@rq/evaluator`.
5) If a task needs wrappers/** or packages/** changes, STOP and say: "Needs separate PR to wrappers." Do not change them.
6) Keep changes ≤400 LOC and ≤3 files per PR.
7) Add or update unit tests when you add logic.
8) Use the design system classes; do not inline new styles.
9) Authoring bundles are immutable after publish.
10) No multi‑app edits. One PR = one app.
